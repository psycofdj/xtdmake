XTDMake is a set of CMake packages that provides easy-to-use targets that generate
code quality measurements reports :
- Doxygen-based documentation
- Coverage of documentation
- Count lines of code
- Cppcheck static analysis
- Unit tests
- Coverage of unit tests
- Memory leak of unit tests


Full documentation is available at http://xtdmake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/


Each target generates both a locally readable and machine processable reports.
Local report targets the developer while the machine-processable reports can be
used in your Continuous Integration (CI) process.
